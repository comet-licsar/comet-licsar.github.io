Notes about documentation
=============

Documentation can be updated simply by editing the rst files in the 'source' folder. After commit, github would auto-recreate web page of https://comet-licsar.github.io .

these are some testing lines

symbol \$


links are automatically converted, e.g. as:

  https://gitlab.com/comet_licsar/licsar_documentation/-/wikis/home.

How do I..
----------

clone and edit the docs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

few steps are needed to clone and set the docs on your computer. first of all, you should set in github page, in Settings of your profile an up-to-date ssh key, formed with the email that is registered with your profile (you may add more emails in github profile settings, it works).

you may do e.g.
::
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed -C "YOURUSERNAME@leeds.ac.uk"

then edit your ~/.ssh/config to contain:
::
  Host github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed
    IdentitiesOnly yes

Afterwards, you can just enter some directory and clone (and set) the repo there using:
::
  git clone git@github.com:comet-licsar/comet-licsar.github.io.git
  cd comet-licsar.github.io
  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:comet-licsar/comet-licsar.github.io.git

ok, then you're set and you can edit and push changes (if you are maintainer) as usual.


prepare hi res frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

say we have an AOI as e.g.

::

  import framecare as fc
  lat1,lon1 = 51.1, 15.7
  lat2,lon2 = 51.8, 16.5
  
  # first get bursts over that AOI, e.g. as:
  bursts = fc.lq.get_bursts_in_polygon(lon1,lon2,lat1,lat2)
  bursts = fc.lq.sql2outlist(bursts)
  
  # now manually check the bursts and select only 1 relorb related..
  bursts = ....
  
  # then generate high res frame with the AOI
  fc.generate_new_frame(bursts, testonly=False, hicode='H')
  

Afterwards initialize the new frame with parameter -C, i.e.:

::

   licsar_initialize_frame.sh -C 15.7/16.5/51.1/51.8 022A_0142H_000203

The library can also be installed using ``pip``::

  pip install sphinx

The rst format was developed for writing documentation. There are numerous markup options available such as using asterisks to emphasise text::

  *emphasised text*

will be rendered as:

*emphasised text*

code example:

.. code:: python

  def function_a(arg_a, arg_b):
      """
      This is function a, which adds two values 
  
      :param arg_a: first argument is a ``float``
      :param arg_b: second argument in an ``int``
      :return: arg_a + arg_b
  
      Example usage::
  
        >>> from python_library import function_a
        >>> function_a(2, 3)
        5
      """
      return arg_a + arg_b

This will produce documentation which renders as:

.. py:function:: python_library.function_a(arg_a, arg_b)
  :noindex:

  This is function a, which adds two values

  :param arg_a: first argument is a ``float``
  :param arg_b: second argument in an ``int``
  :return: arg_a + arg_b

  Example usage::

    >>> from python_library import function_a
    >>> function_a(2, 3)
    5

To include autogenerated documentation, there are various methods available (see the `Sphinx Autodoc Documentation`_), for example, to include documentation for all members of the Python library ``python_library``::

  .. automodule:: python_library
      :members:

this::

  $ make 
  Sphinx v4.4.0
  Please use `make target' where target is one of
    html        to make standalone HTML files
    dirhtml     to make HTML files named index.html in directories
    singlehtml  to make a single large HTML file
  ...

For example, to build HTML documentation, run::

  make html
